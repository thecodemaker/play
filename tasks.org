** TODO - ENVIRONMENTS-1 - create a box from scratch
    *Descrition*: Create a box from scratch.
    *Solution*: created a box based on Ubuntu 16.04 server over which I installed the ubuntu desktop. This is started using
               vagrant.

** TODO - ENVIRONMENTS-2 - optimize the box creating process
    *Description*: We are the ubuntu 16.04 server installation over which we install ubuntu desktop 16.04. This will take
          more time in the build process. Ideally we want for the correct .iso to be used from beginning. The solution
          from now is a workaround to solve some problems ubuntu 16.04 has in the installation process. Now it takes 20
          minutes to create a box and 10 minutes to create the virtualbox machine (depends on network speed).
